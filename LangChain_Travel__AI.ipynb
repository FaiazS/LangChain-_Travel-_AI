            "Think of a model like a map that helps you navigate a new city. The map (model) is a simplified representation of the city's layout, roads, and landmarks. It's not the actual city, but it helps you understand and make predictions about the city's structure and behavior.\n",

            "2. Regression: predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)\n",
            "3. Clustering: grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)\n",

            "3. **Activation functions**: mathematical functions that introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex relationships.\n",
